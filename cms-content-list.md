## 2. FAQs

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Is this official OpenClaw/Moltbot hosting?** | No. Wibble Labs provides managed hosting + setup as an agency service. |
| **Do you provide AI usage / tokens?** | No. You bring your own AI keys (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.). No lock-in. |
| **Do you support WhatsApp?** | Yes, if WhatsApp is part of your requirement. It’s supported as a setup + maintenance service. |
| **Do you guarantee uptime / SLA?** | No formal SLA. It’s best-effort + monitoring, because upstream platforms and providers can change unexpectedly. Our focus is fast recovery and stable setups. |
| **How long does setup take?** | Typically 24–72 hours depending on channels, skills, and integrations. |
| **Can teams use this or only solo founders?** | Both. We can configure it for individuals, founders, ops, and small teams. |
| **Can it do heavy automations / browser tasks?** | Yes. For heavy tasks we recommend a separate worker so the main bot stays stable. |
| **What if I want custom skills or integrations?** | We can build and plug in custom skills as part of the agency service. |
| **Can I leave later?** | Yes. No lock-in. We can hand over or help migrate your setup. |
